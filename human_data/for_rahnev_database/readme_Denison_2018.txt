* RT_decConf: Time elapsed, in seconds, between stimulus onset and simultaneous category/confidence response.
* Difficulty: Refers to the cue validity on each trial, with 1 indicating "valid," 2 indicating "neutral," and 3 indicating "invalid".
* Orientation: Stimulus orientation in degrees.

Block size: 144 trials per block.
