Stimulus and task:
Observers performed an embedded category task in which they categorized drifting grating stimuli (80 ms duration) as drawn from either a narrow distribution around horizontal (SD=3°, category 1) or a wide distribution around horizontal (SD=12°, category 2). Four stimuli (one in each quadrant) were briefly presented on each trial, and a response cue indicated which stimulus to report. Observers simultaneously reported their category choice (category 1 vs. 2) and their degree of confidence on a 4-point scale using one of eight buttons, ranging from high-confidence category 1 to high-confidence category 2. We manipulated voluntary (i.e., endogenous) attention on a trial-to-trial basis using a spatial cue that pointed to either one stimulus location (valid condition: the response cue matched the cue, 66.7% of trials; and invalid condition: it did not match, 16.7% of trials) or all four locations (neutral condition: 16.7% of trials).

Stimulus columns: 
* Stimulus: The name of the category-conditioned stimulus distribution (category 1 or 2) from which an orientation was drawn
* Response: The subject's category choice (1 or 2).
* Confidence: The subject's confidence in their choice, rated on a 1–4 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater degrees of confidence. In training, these responses were labeled "very low," "somewhat low," "somewhat high," and "very high" confidence.
* RT_decConf: Time elapsed, in seconds, between stimulus onset and simultaneous category/confidence response.
* Difficulty: Refers to the cue validity on each trial, with 1 indicating "valid", 2 indicating "neutral", and 3 indicating "invalid”.
* Orientation: Stimulus orientation in degrees.

Block size: 144 trials per block.

Feedback: Trial-by-trial feedback was not provided.
