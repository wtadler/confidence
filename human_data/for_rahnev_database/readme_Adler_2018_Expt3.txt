These data are from Experiment 3.

Stimulus and task:
During each session, each subject completed an orientation categorization task (referred to as Task B in the other experiments from this paper). The stimuli were drifting Gabors. On each trial, a category C was selected randomly (both categories were equally probable), and a stimulus s was drawn from the corresponding stimulus distribution and displayed. The subject categorized the stimulus and simultaneously reported their confidence on a 4-point scale, with a single button press. The categories were defined by normal distributions on orientation. The distributions had the same mean (0°) and different standard deviations (σ_1, σ_2); stimuli around the horizontal were more likely to be from category 1.

Stimulus columns: 
* Stimulus: The name of the category-conditioned stimulus distribution (1 or 2) from which an orientation was drawn
* Response: The subject's belief about the above.
* Confidence: The subject's confidence in their response, rated on a 1–4 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater degrees of confidence. In training, these responses were labeled "very low," "somewhat low," "somewhat high," and "very high" confidence.
* RT_decConf: Time elapsed, in seconds, between stimulus onset and simultaneous category/confidence response.
* Difficulty: Refers to the categorical level of Gabor contrast, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty.
* Orientation: Stimulus orientation in degrees.

Block size: 144 trials per block.

Feedback: Trial-by-trial feedback was not provided.
