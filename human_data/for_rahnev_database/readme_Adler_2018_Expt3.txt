Stimulus columns: 
* Stimulus: The name of the category-conditioned stimulus distribution (1 or 2) from which an orientation was drawn

* RT_decConf: Time elapsed, in seconds, between stimulus onset and simultaneous category/confidence response.
* Difficulty: Refers to the categorical level of Gabor contrast, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty.
* Orientation: Stimulus orientation in degrees.

Block size: 144 trials per block.
