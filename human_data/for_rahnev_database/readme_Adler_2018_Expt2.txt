These data are from Experiment 2.

Stimulus and task:
During each session, each subject completed two orientation categorization tasks, Tasks A and B. The stimuli were drifting Gabors. On each trial, a category C was selected randomly (both categories were equally probable), and a stimulus s was drawn from the corresponding stimulus distribution and displayed. Subjects first reported category choice by pressing one of two buttons with their left hand, and then reported confidence by pressing one of four buttons with their right hand. The categories were defined by normal distributions on orientation, which differed by task. In Task A, the distributions had different means (±μ_C) and the same standard deviation (σ_C); leftward-tilting stimuli were more likely to be from category 1. In Task B, the distributions had the same mean (0°) and different standard deviations (σ_1, σ_2); stimuli around the horizontal were more likely to be from category 1.

Stimulus columns: 
* Stimulus: The name of the category-conditioned stimulus distribution (1 or 2) from which an orientation was drawn
* Response: The subject's belief about the above.
* Confidence: The subject's confidence in their response, rated on a 1–4 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater degrees of confidence. In training, these responses were labeled "very low," "somewhat low," "somewhat high," and "very high" confidence.
* RT_dec: Time elapsed, in seconds, between stimulus onset and category response.
* RT_conf: Time elapsed, in seconds, between category response and confidence response.
* Difficulty: Refers to the categorical level of Gabor contrast, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty.
* Orientation: Stimulus orientation in degrees.
* Task: Subjects did blocks of two different tasks (tasks "A" and "B") in each session.

Block size: 144 trials per block.

Feedback: Trial-by-trial feedback was provided.
