Stimulus columns: 
* Stimulus: The name of the category-conditioned stimulus distribution (1 or 2) from which an orientation was drawn
* Response: The subject's belief about the above.
* Confidence: The subject's confidence in their response, rated on a 1-4 scale, with higher numbers indicating greater degrees of confidence. In training, these responses were labeled "very low," "somewhat low," "somewhat high," and "very high" confidence.
* RT_decConf: Time elapsed, in seconds, between stimulus onset and simultaneous category/confidence response.
* Difficulty: Some subjects saw only Gabors, and some saw only ellipses. This number refers to the categorical level of Gabor contrast or ellipse aspect ratio, with higher numbers indicating greater difficulty.
* Orientation: Stimulus orientation in degrees.
* Task: Subjects did blocks of two different tasks (tasks "A" and "B") in each session.

Block size: 144 trials per block.
Feedback: Trial-by-trial feedback was not provided.
